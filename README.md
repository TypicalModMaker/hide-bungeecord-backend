# How to hide your bungeecord properly

In this repository I will teach you how to **hide** your minecraft server from **griefers** like me!\
You might be asking, who is this guy and why does he want me to do stuff to my server?!\
I am a griefer. This might happen if your server **is not secure**!: [Video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_N-j7jamjQ&), or this [Video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ricF53F6fDE&t=118s), or even this! [Gif #1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/929111080276467723/989227429828653066/80k.mp4), **80k IPS dumped with MD5 encrypted passwords**

**Most of stuff here requires access to the dedicated system and not only the files/console, so if you dont have a vps/vds/dedicated system you cannot hide it completly.**
