# How to hide your bungeecord properly

In this repository I will teach you how to **hide** your Minecraft server from **griefers**!\
You might be asking, who is this guy and why does he want me to do stuff to my server?!\
I am a retired griefer. This might happen if your server **is not secure**!: [Video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_N-j7jamjQ&), or this [Video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ricF53F6fDE&t=118s), or even this! [Gif #1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/929111080276467723/989227429828653066/80k.mp4), **80k IPS dumped with MD5 encrypted passwords** 

Now you probably think that I am a bad person and that I am not trustworthy! Well **you are wrong**! **Over 30 people trust me** with their server security! If you want to contact some of them on discord:

**Every point flagged with 游린 Requires a vps/vds/dedicated system. This means that these points wont work if you are using a Minecraft server hosting**

### 1. Reverse TCP Proxy:
#### &nbsp;1.1 Choosing the best reverse proxy
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of reverse proxies available on the internet, most popular ones are: [TCPSHIELD](https://tcpshield.com/), [Infi ninity Filter](https://www.infinity-filter.com/) and [MC SHIELD](https://mcshield.com/).\
&nbsp;\
&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend using [EnkiProtect](https://enkiprotect.info/), Its not popular, but its very powerful. It also has alot of features like AntiBot, AntiVPN and  **unlimited traffic!** This is probably the best option you could pick. Check the site for more info.
### 2. UUID Spoofing:
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. What is UUID Spoofing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;UUID spoofing was first discovered in early 2013, and is now a well-known Bungeecord design flaw - mainly abused to grief servers. This exploit is one of the most used methods to gain administrator privileges on vulnerable Minecraft servers.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. What are the consequences for ignoring this problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring UUID spoofing will make your server vulnerable and exposed to everyone. This might result in all of your player's ip being leaked, your network getting completly destroyed or even your server being deleted! So you better check if your server is vulnerable ASAP.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. On what servers does this design flaw work
&nbsp;&nbsp;This flaw works on every single bungeecord instance (including forks such as flamecord, waterfall) that are connected to Java Edition Servers.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4. How to block it
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.1 External: IPWhitelist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPWhitelist allows to filter out the connections at specific spigot server for specific IP Addresses      https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ipwhitelist.61/ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration is pretty simple, check the spigot page for more info.
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.2 External: Bungeeguard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bungeeguard allows to add a "token" system to your spigot and bungee server. https://github.com/lucko/BungeeGuard \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration is pretty simple, check the spigot page for more info.
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.3 External: Velocity Protection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works the same as BungeeGuard, provided in velocity config. https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration is pretty simple, check provided page for more info.
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.3 Internal: Firewalling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firewalling is possible by using tool such as iptables/ufw on linux servers \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is for more advanced people - if you don't know basic linux commands I recommend sticking to plugins, plugins are good but they dont provide maximum security. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 2 tools we can use: IPTables | UFW \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UFW Steps: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Install ufw with ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ufw``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Allow ssh connections with ```sudo ufw allow 22``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Allow proxy connections with ```sudo ufw allow 25565``` Change ```25565``` to your proxy port! 丘멆잺WARNING丘멆잺: Don't do this if you're using a reverse proxy, look at point 3.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPTables is more advanced (This article would be too long to explain, I manage iptables with ease), so instead of explaining every step I'll link a great spigotmc article \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/#firewalling-with-iptables
### 3. Hide Bungeecord:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding bungeecord can be done by using a reverse proxy from point 1. and firewalling your proxy to their IPs \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to firewall with UFW:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Install ufw with ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ufw``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Allow proxy connections with ```sudo ufw allow from $IP proto tcp to any port 25565```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change ```25565``` to your proxy port and $IP to your revere proxy IP (this is different for every provider, contact them for their IPs!) \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Repeat step 2 with every reverse proxy ip, tcpshield ips: https://tcpshield.com/v4/ (Make sure you also use the subnets aka / and numbers after it) \
